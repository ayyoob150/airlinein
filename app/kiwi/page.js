        <p>Founded in 2012 in Brno, Czech Republic, Kiwi.com—originally launched as SkyPicker.com by entrepreneurs Oliver Dlouhy and Jozef Képesi—has evolved into one of Europe's largest and most innovative travel platforms. In 2016, the company rebranded to Kiwi.com after acquiring the premium domain name for $800,000, signaling a bold step toward global recognition.</p>
        <p>Today, Kiwi.com processes over 100 million travel searches daily and facilitates the sale of travel itineraries worth billions of CZK annually, making it a leader in the online travel industry.</p>
        <p>The company is backed by global private equity firm General Atlantic, which acquired a majority stake in 2019. Despite this, the founding team retains a significant share, ensuring that the original vision continues to drive the business forward.</p>
